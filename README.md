# dailycalendar

In this project, we had to make a daily calendar with a local storage ability and a function that would help show you what times have passed to
have a more accurate schedule.


I learnt a lot during this project.
I had two different tutors plus my uncle who codes to help me. 
It still took me and couple days and 5 hours today to complete.
my second tutor and I still had time so he showed me how to create a clear button. 
The only problem that i had was uploading it online. I had errors with merge history and tried everything online but to no avail.
